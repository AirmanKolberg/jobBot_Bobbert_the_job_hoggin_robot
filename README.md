# jobBot_Bobbert_the_job_hoggin_robot
A little script on which I'm working just to automate job searches over time.  Eventually, this little guy should be able to search for very specific jobs, or at least get you started with prompt notifications as to exactly when a new job has been posted that may be of interest to you.

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!

Thank you all for reading!
